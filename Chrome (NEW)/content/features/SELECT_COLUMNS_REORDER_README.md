# Select Columns Reorder Feature

## Overview
This feature adds bulk reordering functionality to Magic ETL's "Select Columns" transformation, making it easier to reorder multiple columns without having to drag them one by one.

## Features Added

### 1. Individual Column Move Buttons
- **Move Up/Down buttons** appear next to each column in the Select Columns list
- Small up/down chevron icons allow moving columns one position at a time
- Buttons are automatically disabled for the first (up) and last (down) columns

### 2. Bulk Reorder Button
- **Sort icon button** added to the toolbar next to other action buttons (duplicate, delete, etc.)
- Opens a modal dialog for bulk reordering operations

### 3. Bulk Reorder Modal
- **Drag and Drop**: Columns can be dragged and dropped to new positions
- **Move Buttons**: Each column has individual up/down buttons in the modal
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and proper button states
- **Apply/Cancel**: Changes can be applied or cancelled

## How It Works

### Detection
- The feature automatically detects when a "Select Columns" transformation is active
- It monitors for DOM changes and adds the UI elements when appropriate

### UI Integration
- Follows Domo's existing design patterns and CSS classes
- Uses consistent button styles and icons from Domo's design system
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing toolbar

### User Experience
1. **Quick Moves**: Use the small up/down buttons for moving columns one position
2. **Bulk Reordering**: Click the sort button in the toolbar to open the reorder modal
3. **Drag & Drop**: In the modal, drag columns to reorder them quickly
4. **Apply Changes**: Click "Apply Changes" to implement the new column order

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Follows the modular pattern used by other Domo Helper features
- Clean separation of concerns with init/cleanup/applySettings methods
- Proper event handling and memory management

### DOM Interaction
- Uses mutation observers to detect when Select Columns is active
- Safely injects UI elements without breaking existing functionality
- Properly cleans up when navigating away or switching transformations

### CSS Styling
- All styles are scoped to avoid conflicts with Domo's existing CSS
- Responsive design that works with Domo's layout system
- Consistent visual hierarchy and interaction patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+Up/Down for quick column moves
2. **Multi-Select**: Select multiple columns and move them together
3. **Template Patterns**: Save and apply common column orders
4. **Search/Filter**: Find columns quickly in large lists

### Integration Points
- Could integrate with column tracing features (from roadmap)
- Potential for saved column order templates
- Enhanced accessibility features

## Notes

### Current Limitations
- The actual reordering logic interfaces with Domo's internal drag-and-drop system
- Some advanced reordering operations might require additional reverse engineering
- Performance optimized for typical column counts (up to 50-100 columns)

### Compatibility
- Works with Domo's current Magic ETL interface (2024-2025)
- Designed to be resilient to minor UI changes in Domo
- Follows Chrome extension best practices for security and performance
